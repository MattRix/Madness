Madness
=======

A repository for my Ludum Dare 24 game (being made over the Aug 25th weekend)

The code in this repo will probably be broken a lot, so if you want to try it out, grab the most recent tag: https://github.com/MattRix/Madness/tags

To open the project in Unity, open up /build/unity/Assets/Scenes/Madness.unity 

In theory it should just work, but I'm not making any promises :)
