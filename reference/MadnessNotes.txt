__________

Polish:

- When enemies drop coins, they should tween into your coin pile
- If a dude is in attack range, he shouldn't bother going to the target until he's done attacking
- Click and hold to attack... a little circle should scale in for 1 second until the hold is "activated"
- Tons of little ! above all the frog heads when they get a new attack order? Maybe they just blink or something
- On screen stats like current wads count, "Wads killed", indicator if you're maxed out, DNA points, etc. Collect DNA!
- Zoom in and slowmo on the final hit! like peggle
- Put stuff on the desk beside the petri dish. lab notes?
- Tower attacks critters?
- Image effects: bloom, color correction, etc!
__________

Futile changes:
- Sort the resolution levels
